The spots are irregularly shaped and have a darker green color compared to the surrounding leaf tissue. The leaf has a heart-shaped outline and appears to be slightly curved. The surface of the leaf is smooth, and there are no visible hairs or other textural features. The edges of the leaf are smooth and straight. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, or wilting. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, and it appears to be of a similar color and texture to the leaf itself.",
