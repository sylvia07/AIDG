The spots are purple in color and appear to be irregularly shaped, with some overlapping each other. The leaf has a smooth surface with no visible hairs or other textures. The edges of the leaf are smooth and straight. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, wilting, or lesions. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, and it appears to be of a similar color and texture to the leaf itself.",
