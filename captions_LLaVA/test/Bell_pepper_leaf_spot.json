There are multiple spots on the leaf, which appear to be reddish-brown in color and are irregular in shape, with some spots being larger and more prominent than others. The spots are scattered across the surface of the leaf, with some located near the edges and others more centrally. The leaf has a smooth surface with no visible hairs or other textural features. The edges of the leaf are straight and appear to be smooth. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, or wilting, on the leaf. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, and it appears to be of a similar color and texture to the leaf itself.",
