        "text": "The image shows a close-up of a plant leaf with a green base color. There are several spots on the leaf, which appear to be discolored areas. These spots are irregular in shape, with varying sizes and lengths. The spots are located on the upper surface of the leaf, and their color is a lighter shade of green compared to the base color. The leaf has a smooth surface with no visible hairs or other textural features. The edges of the leaf are smooth and straight. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, wilting, or lesions. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, with a smooth texture.",
