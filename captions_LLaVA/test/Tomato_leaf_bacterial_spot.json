        "text": "The image shows a plant leaf with a base color of green. There are several spots on the leaf, which appear to be yellow and are distributed unevenly across the surface. The spots are irregular in shape and size, with some larger spots and smaller spots interspersed. The leaf has a heart-shaped outline and a smooth surface. The edges of the leaf are serrated. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, or wilting, on the leaf. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, and it appears to be of a similar color and texture to the leaf itself. The image is a close-up photograph with a blue background, and there is text at the bottom right corner that reads \"S. Vann.\"",
